                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>To create digital systems that serve both business objectives and human needs through principled design, clean code, and systematic thinking.</p>
                    
                    <p>We reject the false choice between beautiful design and functional systems. Instead, we pursue the mathematical harmony found in nature—the golden ratio that appears in everything from nautilus shells to classical architecture—and apply these principles to digital experiences.</p>
                    
                    <p>Every line of code, every visual element, every user interaction is intentionally crafted to create systems that are not just functional, but elegant. Not just usable, but delightful. Not just scalable, but sustainable.</p>

                        <li><strong>Systematic Thinking</strong> - Every decision backed by research, data, and proven principles</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematical Precision</strong> - Golden ratio proportions and mathematical harmony in all design decisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Human Empathy</strong> - Technology that serves people, not the other way around</li>
                        <li><strong>Sustainable Craft</strong> - Code and design that stands the test of time</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous Learning</strong> - Always evolving our methods and understanding</li>

                    <h3>The Golden Ratio Foundation</h3>
                    <p>Nature's most pleasing proportions—found in everything from flower petals to galaxy spirals—guide our visual hierarchy, spacing, and component relationships. This isn't arbitrary aesthetic choice; it's mathematical harmony that humans are naturally drawn to.</p>

                    <h3>Systems Over Solutions</h3>
                    <p>We don't just solve today's problems; we create flexible systems that adapt to tomorrow's challenges. Every component, pattern, and piece of code is designed to work as part of a larger, cohesive whole.</p>

                    <h3>Performance as Feature</h3>
                    <p>Speed isn't just technical requirement—it's user experience. Every byte of code is optimized, every asset compressed, every interaction streamlined for maximum performance and minimum friction.</p>

                    <p>Inclusive design isn't optional. We build for keyboard navigation, screen readers, color blindness, and cognitive differences from day one. Good design works for everyone.</p>
