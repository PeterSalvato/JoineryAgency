# Design System Fundamentals

A well-crafted design system is the foundation of any successful digital product. Here's how we approach building systems that scale.

## The Golden Ratio Advantage

By basing our measurements on the golden ratio (1.618), we create naturally harmonious proportions that feel right to users.

## Component Architecture

Every component is built with:
- Semantic HTML structure
- BEM methodology for CSS
- Responsive breakpoints
- Accessibility best practices

## Scalability Considerations

Design systems must grow with your product while maintaining consistency across all touchpoints.
