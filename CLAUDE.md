# CLAUDE.md - Agency Office Hub

**This repository is the central office space for Joinery Systemworks - an AI-powered design consultancy. All agency operations, standards, and client work are coordinated from here.**

## üö® COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

### üî• MANDATORY: Read Documentation First
**Before ANY task or discussion:**

1. **CHECK** `git status` and recent file changes to catch any planning updates
2. **READ** the relevant documentation completely (including any recent untracked/modified files)
3. **DEMONSTRATE** understanding by summarizing key points  
4. **VALIDATE** your approach matches existing patterns
5. **PROCEED** only after confirmation

**Never say "Oh I didn't see that" - this indicates failed validation**

## üìã Essential Documentation (READ FIRST)

### Agency Operations
- **`/CURRENT_PLANNING.md`** - Current session context and active decisions
- **`/docs/conventions.md`** - Development standards and coding requirements
- **`/docs/symbol-index.md`** - System architecture and component relationships

### Client Work  
- **`/projects/`** - All client projects with individual CLAUDE.md dispatch files
- Each client project has its own conventions, symbols, and planning docs

### Website Development
- **`/.website/`** - Agency website with its own documentation system
- **`/.website/docs/`** - Website-specific planning and conventions

## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance Protocol

### Update Requirements
**MANDATORY**: Update documentation for any changes to standards, architecture, or planning
- Planning decisions ‚Üí Update `CURRENT_PLANNING.md` with **summary + link to detailed doc**
- Development standards ‚Üí Update `docs/conventions.md`  
- New code/components ‚Üí Update `docs/symbol-index.md`
- **Detailed planning docs encouraged** - but must be indexed in main planning file

**CURRENT_PLANNING.md = session index, not comprehensive planning document**

## üè¢ What This Office Contains
