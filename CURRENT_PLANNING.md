# CURRENT PLANNING - Production Department

**Session Started**: September 3, 2025  
**Status**: Active Planning  
**Context**: Rebuilding lost production department planning

## Session History
- **Previous Session Lost**: Complete production department planning session was lost due to session persistence issues
- **Context7 Investigation**: Attempted context7 MCP setup but requires external Upstash dependency (rejected)
- **Solution Implemented**: Active planning file management with git-based persistence

## Current Planning Focus: Production Department

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Define Production Department Type**: What kind of production are we planning? (web development, design, manufacturing, etc.)
2. **Scope Definition**: Scale, team size, core functions
3. **Structure Planning**: Roles, hierarchy, workflows
4. **Resource Requirements**: Technology, tools, budget
5. **Implementation Timeline**: Phases and milestones

### Decisions Made This Session
- ✅ Rejected context7 MCP due to external dependency requirements
- ✅ Implemented active planning file management approach
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with planning documentation requirements
- ✅ Established git-based session continuity
