# CURRENT PLANNING - Production Department

**Session Started**: September 3, 2025  
**Status**: Active Planning  
**Context**: Rebuilding lost production department planning

## Session History
- **Previous Session Lost**: Complete production department planning session was lost due to session persistence issues
- **Context7 Investigation**: Attempted context7 MCP setup but requires external Upstash dependency (rejected)
- **Solution Implemented**: Active planning file management with git-based persistence

## Current Planning Focus: Production Department

**CONCEPT DEFINED**: Production agents that can operate tooling on behalf of consultant agents
- **28 consultant agents** exist for consultation/advice
- **Need production agents** for each domain to execute recommendations
- Production agents handle tools, code generation, implementation tasks

### Production Agent Architecture - ANSWERED
**DECISION**: Production agents structured like functions with routines/subroutines
- **Fewer production agents** than consultants
- **Function-like behavior**: Modular, composable, reusable routines
- **Hierarchical structure**: Main functions call subroutines as needed

### Production Agent Architecture - DECIDED
**APPROACH**: Technical domain-based production agents (4-6 agents)

**Core Production Agents**:
- **code-producer**: HTML, CSS, JS, frameworks
- **design-producer**: Images, layouts, assets
- **content-producer**: Copy, docs, marketing materials  
- **data-producer**: Research, analysis, reports

**Architecture Pattern**:
- Function-like behavior with modular routines
- Each agent has main functions + subroutines
- Composable across different consultant recommendations
- Clear separation by output type/tooling

### Production Agent Architecture - FINALIZED
**DECISION**: 6 specialized production agents

**Final Production Agent List**:
1. **code-producer**: HTML, CSS, JS, frameworks
2. **design-producer**: Images, layouts, assets, visual elements
3. **content-producer**: Copy, docs, marketing materials
4. **data-producer**: Research, analysis, reports
5. **deployment-producer**: Hosting, CI/CD, domains, infrastructure
6. **integration-producer**: APIs, databases, third-party services

### Workflow Architecture Discussion
**CONCERN IDENTIFIED**: Individual consultants controlling their own production agents could get messy fast

**Alternative Approaches**:
1. **Central Orchestrator**: Single system manages all consultant → production handoffs
2. **Production Manager**: Dedicated agent that routes requests from consultants to appropriate producers
3. **Workflow Engine**: Standardized pipeline that handles multi-step consultant + production sequences
4. **Request Queue**: Consultants submit standardized requests, system dispatches to producers

**Key Questions**:
- Who coordinates when multiple production agents needed for one task?
- How to prevent conflicts when multiple consultants need same producer?
- How to ensure consistency across production outputs?

### Production Architecture - DECIDED
**SOLUTION**: Production Manager with standardized interfaces

**Flow Architecture**:
1. **Consultant Agents** → provide recommendations/specs
2. **Production Manager** → receives all requests, routes and coordinates  
3. **Production Manager** → formats uniform input for each production agent
4. **6 Production Agents** → receive standardized input format, execute tasks
5. **Production Manager** → aggregates outputs, handles sequencing

**Benefits**:
- Single point of coordination (no chaos)
- Standardized interfaces across all production agents
- Clean separation: consultants advise, production manager orchestrates, producers execute
- Easier to manage conflicts, dependencies, and consistency

### Standardized Input Format - DECIDED
**APPROACH**: YAML-based task specification (refinement will happen in practice)

```yaml
task_id: "unique-identifier"
task_type: "generate_css" | "create_image" | "deploy_site" | etc
specifications: { /* task-specific details */ }
dependencies: [ /* other tasks this depends on */ ]
output_format: "files" | "data" | "deployment"
priority: "high" | "normal" | "low"
```
