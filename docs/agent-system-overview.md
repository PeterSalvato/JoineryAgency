# Agent System Overview

## Philosophy
Our AI agency uses specialist personas based on proven expert methodologies rather than generic AI responses. Each agent embodies a specific domain expert's approach, frameworks, and thinking patterns.

## Consultation Model

### How It Works
1. **User identifies need** - Specific challenge or domain expertise required
2. **Agent selection** - Most relevant specialist for the challenge
3. **Focused consultation** - Actionable advice using proven methodology
4. **User implementation** - User decides which recommendations to apply
5. **Follow-up available** - Additional specialists can be consulted if needed
