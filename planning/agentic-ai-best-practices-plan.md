## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing agentic AI systems based on industry best practices. The plan focuses on building reliable, scalable, and maintainable AI agent architectures using proven patterns and methodologies.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Two-Tier Agent Model
**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Primary Agent (Orchestrator)**
  - Maintains conversation context and user state
  - Handles task planning and decomposition
  - Manages subagent coordination and results synthesis
  - Implements error handling and fallback strategies

- **Specialized Subagents**
  - Stateless, focused on specific capabilities
  - Return structured, predictable outputs
  - Enable parallel execution and independent scaling

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Design primary agent interface and context management
- [ ] Define subagent specification template
- [ ] Create agent registry and discovery mechanism
- [ ] Implement agent lifecycle management

### 2. Stateless Subagent Design
**Implementation Strategy:**
- Design agents as pure functions with deterministic outputs
- Eliminate shared memory and persistent state
- Enable horizontal scaling and fault tolerance

**Technical Requirements:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Structured output formatting
- Error state communication
- Performance metrics collection

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Define stateless agent interface contract
- [ ] Create agent testing framework for consistency
- [ ] Implement input/output validation schemas
- [ ] Build agent performance monitoring

## Task Management Framework

### 3. Task Decomposition Strategies
**Vertical Decomposition (Sequential Tasks):**
```
User Request → Task Analysis → Step 1 → Step 2 → Step N → Result Synthesis
```

**Horizontal Decomposition (Parallel Tasks):**
```
User Request → Task Division → [Task A | Task B | Task C] → Result Aggregation
```

**Mixed Strategy Implementation:**
- Analyze task dependencies and requirements
- Apply appropriate decomposition pattern
- Implement dynamic strategy selection

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create task analysis and classification system
- [ ] Build dependency graph generator
- [ ] Implement parallel execution framework
- [ ] Design result aggregation mechanisms

### 4. Communication Protocols
**Structured Task Specification:**
```yaml
task:
  objective: "Clear, specific task description"
  context: "Relevant background information"
  constraints: "Limitations and boundaries"
  output_format: "Expected result structure"
  success_criteria: "Measurable completion indicators"
```

**Response Format:**
```yaml
response:
  status: "success | partial | failed"
  result: "Primary task output"
  metadata:
    confidence: 0.0-1.0
    processing_time: "execution duration"
    resources_used: "model, tokens, etc."
  recommendations: "Follow-up actions or optimizations"
  errors: "Failure details if applicable"
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Define communication schema standards
- [ ] Create protocol validation system
- [ ] Build message routing and queuing
- [ ] Implement response parsing and validation
